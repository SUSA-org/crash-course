# Basics

All the code in this repository is expected to run on Python 3.6+

Various libraries needed to execute code samples and jupyter notebooks are listed in requirements.txt

If using conda, one can also use conda.txt to create the corresponding conda env. Then install the pip requirements.

```sh
conda create --name NAME --file conda.txt
```

To then download the libraries efficiently using pip, download this repository, and run

```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
