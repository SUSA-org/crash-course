Using bash

This is mostly note to self:

When runing commands on another instance or computer, use these commands to make sure commands do not get executed after ending the terminal.

$ nohup COMMAND > FILE
This creates a file called FILE that stores the output of running the command.

$ nohup COMMAND > FILE && sudo halt/shutdown
This saves output of the commadn into FILE, and immediately shuts the instance down. (Saves $$$)

Alternatively,
$ tmux new -s SESSION NAME
$ COMMAND
$ ^B-D
Session detached

Will run a given COMMAND in a tmux session called SESSION NAME (no spaces in the actual name). ^B-D will cleanly detach the tmux session, so that quitting the shell will not kill the command.
To reattach to the session, and see the output, run

$ tmux attach SESSION NAME
