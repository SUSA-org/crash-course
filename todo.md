# TODO Readme

These are a few core topics that we could use help writing tutorials on. In general, feel free to pull request any material you believe is relevant. Worst-case scenario, we just work with you to change a few lines or something.


## Notes:

We assume basic Python 3.5/3.6+ proficiency because so many people know it as a result of Data 8 & CS 61a. However, we do not expect any R proficiency.
