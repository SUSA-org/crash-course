# Introduction

In this mini-tutorial, you will learn how to install [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (a statistical programming language) and [RStudio](https://rstudio.com) (an *integrated development environment (IDE)* for R programming). This tutorial is the prerequisite for **r1**, SUSA's crash course on R for data science and statistics.

## What is R?

Before we begin installing R, *what is R anyway*? 

The first thing to notice about R is that it's **open-source** - that is, R is free to use and anyone can see how it was made! The free and open nature of R led to the formation of the **R community**, a constantly-expanding network of individuals who contribute ideas and code to R and all of its packages, free-of-charge. But more on what R is actually used for...

#### R is a **programming language**.

Just like Python, R is a programming language. Its **syntax** (aka specific language structure) is a little different than Python's, but a lot of it is identical! For example, in both languages, *printing* a string to the console is done via the same command:
```{python}
print("Hello SUSA!") ## Printing in Python
```
```{r}
print("Hello SUSA!") ## Printing in R
```

R is the name of both the language for computational tasks as well as the **runtime environment** that actually reads *commands* and *scripts* written in the R language to execute tasks. (Note: A **command** is generally used to describe an interactive style of programming, where you enter commands line-by-line in a console. An ordered list of commands comprises a **script**, which can be run automatically by the `R` program as well.)

#### R is a **tool for statistics**.

In contrast to Python, R is not a general programming language. Rather, R was developed for the use of **data scientists** and **statisticians** specifically. Because of this, many statistical tasks are very easily provided by even the **base R libraries**. For example, manipulating data and creating and evaluating linear models are readily available in R by default via the `data.frame()` and `lm()` commands respectively. 

To do such tasks in Python, packages such as `pandas` and `scikit-learn` must be installed first. Of course, if you have already installed Anaconda in `py0` of the SUSA Crash Course curriculum, you have these packages installed already.

(*Note: A **package** (very similar to a **library** or **module**) is an addition to a **base program** that gives it more commands and functionality. For example, the `ggplot2` package is a package for R that allows you to create high-quality graphs and visualizations.*)

**Because R was made specifically with statistics in mind, it is a premier language for statistical computing, data visualization, and machine learning. R makes data science incredibly quick to write and simple to understand.**

#### R is a **data visualization suite**.

In addition to running statistical computations, R is very useful for graphing data as well. Especially within the context of RStudio, R (in conjuction with the `ggplot2` package) can be used to make sophisticated displays of data, useful in both  *exploratory data analysis* (**EDA**) and *presentation of research findings*. 

## What is RStudio?

By itself, R is a powerful programming language. However, its basic use is command-line only. In order to make writing R easier for statisticians, a group of statisticians based in Boston developed **RStudio**, an IDE for R programming. An **IDE** (*integrated development environment*) is a program designed to facilitate programming in a particular language. RStudio is a desktop (or server) application that eliminates the need for a CLI (as it comes packaged in RStudio itself) and includes a **notebook panel** for writing and running scripts. But this just scratches the surface of RStudio's features...

#### RStudio is for **joining various components in R**.

RStudio is your one-stop shop for programming in R, reading R scripts and data, looking at help manuals, interactively running through tutorials and notebooks, and even making presentations like this one! 

Just to name a few other features of RStudio, here are some of the more popular ones:
- Managing packages
- Displaying help and documentation
- Cloud computing
- Viewing and exporting visualizations
- Publishing reports, presentations, and websites
- Animated and interactive graphs
- Writing in Python, C, Ruby, Bash, and more
- Writing LaTeX

#### RStudio is for **beautifying outputs**.

As mentioned above, this workshop was made entirely in RStudio with the help of the `knitr` package (included by default). You can make professional research reports in the form of PDFs, webpages like this one (which can even include interactive graphs and code), and slide presentations.

Additionally, RStudio was created to interface well with `ggplot2` and other datavis packages, allowing you to save plots as files on your computer, with options to specify resolution and picture size. 

#### RStudio is for **getting help quickly**.

At anytime while writing an **R Markdown** or **R Notebook** file, you can use the console to test functions and read the associated documentation.

For example, if you're ever curious about what a function (e.g. `lm`) does, simply type e.g. `?lm` into the R interactive console to the lower-left of the application.

#### RStudio is for **sharing open workflows**.

Did you know? RStudio is compatible with Git (and Github)! Simply opening up a Git repository in RStudio allows you to add, commit, push, and pull all within RStudio itself - no need to open up your Terminal to do it from there!

In addition, because RStudio's outputs are fully readable by any other computer (even computers that don't have R or RStudio installed), RStudio facilitates in the sharing of code and statistical reports. 

### **RStudio Desktop** vs **RStudio Server**
Of note, there are actually *two versions of RStudio*. The first is **RStudio Desktop**, which will be covered by this tutorial. RStudio Desktop will run as a local application on your computer. The second version of RStudio, **RStudio Server**, will run as a locally-hosted server. If you were to link up that server to the Internet, you could access your RStudio server as a webpage, and run R scripts "on the cloud". For most users, **RStudio Desktop** is more than enough for now.

## What is CRAN?

You may have noticed some of the pages referred to in this guide contain links related to CRAN. **CRAN** (*The **C**omprehensive **R** **A**rchive **N**etwork*) is a network of servers that each hold an identical **mirror** (*synchronized download link*) to various R packages, and the base R program itself. Universities and labs around the world maintain these servers, ensuring they are all up-to-date at all times. For example, Berkeley hosts its own server for R downloads, located at [cran.cnr.berkeley.edu](
https://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu/).

# Installing R
## For Mac
1. Visit [the R downloads page for Mac](https://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu/bin/macosx/) and follow the link to the latest version of base R (as of the writing of this workshop, [**R 3.4.3**](https://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu/bin/macosx/R-3.4.3.pkg)).  
2. Run the downloaded `.pkg` installer and follow the installation steps. For most users, the default specifications will do just fine.
3. After you are finished, test your R installation by running `R` in your Bash console. *Note: in contrast to most CLI commands, `R` **must** be uppercase*.
  + Once R is running, try commands like `2+3` or `log(8, base = 2)`
  + Quit R by entering `q()` (there is no need to save the workspace image)

## For Windows
1. Visit [the R downloads page for Windows](https://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu/bin/windows/) and follow the link to the latest version of base R (as of the writing of this workshop, [**R 3.4.3**](https://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu/bin/windows/base/R-3.4.3-win.exe)).  
2. Run the downloaded `.exe` installer and follow the installation steps. For most users, the default specifications will do just fine.

# Conclusion
Today, we learned about R, RStudio, and CRAN. To summarize, R is a statistical programming language and runtime environment hosted by the CRAN mirros. RStudio is a (desktop) program used to write in R effectively, and includes a multitude of features to enhance the R programming experience. We then learned how to install R and RStudio from Berkeley's CRAN mirror. 

Stay tuned for next week's workshop, **r1**, on basic R programming!
