# About this Document
This is the associated workbook for the [r2](r2.html) tutorial on R programming and tidyverse. Using RStudio, replace each ` > TODO ` with a code chunk that answers the associated problem. Then, run the chunk to verify your answers. Some problems require a non-code answer, so simply replace ` > TODO ` with the correct textual answer.

# Data Wranging

## `dplyr`

### `head`, `View`, `arrange`

A pop-quiz on `%>%` from the `magrittr` package! Write a command to view the `iris` dataset in two ways, one with piping and one without. What do you notice about the tab titles of each?

> TODO

Use `head` to read the first ten lines of the `iris` dataset.

> TODO

Read the documentation of `head`. How could we easily see the **last** ten lines of the `iris` dataset?

> TODO

Using `View`, see if you can find out how many entries are in the `iris` dataset.

> TODO

Using `desc` and `tail`, find an alternative command to find the shortest six petals in the `iris` dataset.

> TODO

### Dataframe Subsetting

#### Row Selection (`sample_*`, `slice`, `filter`)

Read the documentation for `sample_n` to determine how to sample **with replacement**. Using the following dataframe, simulate ten rolls of a die.
```{r}
dice <- data.frame(Dots = 1:6)
## TODO
```

Use `sample_n` and `nrow` (outputs the number of rows in a dataframe) to write `scramble`, a function that takes in a dataframe and outputs the same dataframe in a scrambled order.

> TODO

Using `slice`, write `my_head`, a function that operates identically to the default behavior of the `head` function. Use the following function header:
```{r}
my_head <- function(df, size = 6) {
  ## TODO
}
```


Select only the setosa flowers in `iris` with Sepal.Length's over 5.

> TODO

#### Column Selection (`select`, `rename`, `pull`)

Use `select` to make a sub-dataframe of `iris` with only the columns about lengths.

> TODO

Rename the columns of `iris` to have more natural grammar. (Read: spaces rather than periods). 

> TODO

In your own words, what is the difference betwee `select` and `pull`?

> TODO

In `r2`, what was the difference in behavior between using `select` vs. using `rename` on the `iris` dataset? How would you fix the `select` statement to work identically in this case?

> TODO

Using `select`, write `my_rename`, a function that operates (nearly) identically to the default behavior of the `rename` function. Use the following function header:
```{r}
my_rename <- function(df, ...) {
  ## TODO
}
```

### Adding & Modifying Columns (`mutate`, `transmute`)

#### `mutate`

What are the two uses for `mutate`? 

> TODO

Use `mutate` to make a two new columsn in `iris`, 1) `Petal/Sepal Width Ratio`, the ratio between `Petal.Width` and `Sepal.Width` and 2) `Petal Area`, using `Petal.Width` and `Petal.Length`.

> TODO

In the above problem, what is the window function you used to calculate `Petal/Sepal Width Ratio`? What is the window function used to calculate `Petal Area`?

> TODO

Challenge question! Look up the documentation for `mutate_if`, and use it to modify `iris`to have its numerical values in units of inches rather than centimeters (what it is now).

> TODO

#### `transmute`

In your own words, what is the difference between `mutate` and `transmute`?

> TODO 

### `summarise`, `summary`

Use `summarise` to compute the largest petal lengths and petal widths in the `iris` dataset. (For the particularily adventurous, try to figure out how to use `summarise_at` for this problem). 

> TODO 

In the above problem, what is the **summary function** you used to calculate the summary columns? 

> TODO

In your own words, what is `summary` useful for? 

> TODO 

In your own words, what is the difference between `summarise` and `summary`?

> TODO

### Grouped Data

In your own words, what is the purpose or function of grouping data?

> TODO

Find the largest petal lengths and petal widths in the `iris` dataset **for each Species**. (Again, for the particularily adventurous, try to figure out how to use `summarise_at` for this problem).

> TODO

Use grouped `mutate` and the `arrange` function to sort the flowers in `iris` by `Petal.Length`, within their Species.

> TODO

### Combining Datasets

In your own words, what is the difference between **binds** and **joins**?

> TODO

Bind the following two dataframes into a single dataframe, row-wise:
```{r}
a <- data.frame(ID = 1:3, Name = c("Alice", "Bob", "Catherine"), Age = c(19, 19, 21))
b <- data.frame(ID = 3:5, Name = c("Dennis", "Edward"), Age = c(22, 20))
## TODO
```

Bind the following three dataframes into a single dataframe, column-wise:
```{r}
a <- data.frame(ID = 1:5, Name = c("Alice", "Bob", "Catherine", "Dennis", "Edward"))
b <- data.frame(Age = c(19, 19, 21, 22, 20))
## TODO
```

Join the following two dataframes:
```{r}
a <- data.frame(ID = 1:5, Name = c("Alice", "Bob", "Catherine", "Dennis", "Edward"))
b <- data.frame(ID = c(5, 3, 4, 2, 1), Age = c(20, 21, 22, 19, 19))
## TODO
```

In your own words, what is the difference between a **left join** and an **inner join**?

> TODO

## `tidyr`

Make a small tidy dataset.

> TODO

Make a small wide dataset.

> TODO 

### `gather`

Tidy the following dataset and save it to the variable `tidy_practice_df`:
```{r, warning = F}
wide_practice_df <- data.frame(`CS61A` = "A-",`S134` = "B-", `S133` = "A", `S135` = "B+", check.names = F)
## TODO
```

### `spread`

Now, take your `tidy_practice_df` and put it back into the wide format of `wide_practice_df`.

> TODO

### NA Values

What does `NA` represent? Why are `NA` values "bad"?

> TODO

Clean out the `NA` values in the following dataset, in two ways.

```{r}
dirty_practice_df <- data.frame(A = rnorm(5, 10, 5), B = c(T, NA, NA, NA, F))
## TODO: tidyr approach
## TODO: dplyr approach
```

# Data Import 

## `readr` & `readxl`

Use `readr` to read in `data/wellcome_apc_articles.csv`. You don't need to worry about cleaning - that will be the topic of the first mini-project.

> TODO 

Use `readxl` to read in `data/plant-ants.xls`. You don't need to worry about tidying - that will be the topic of the second mini-project. (*Hint: Use the `range` argument*)

> TODO

## Column Types

What is a **factor**? How does it differ from the **character** type?

> TODO

What are the two ways to specify the `col_types` argument in `readr` functions?

> TODO

# Functional Programming in R (`purrr`)

In your own words, what is **functional programming**?

> TODO

## The `map` Family

Make a function called `quadratic_solver(a, b, c)` that finds the larger root of a quadratic polynomial.

> TODO

Use `quadratic_solver` and one of the `map_*` functions to output a vector of the larger roots of the following polynomials:   
$\{6x^2 + 12x - 15, x^2 - 3x - 90, x^2 + x - 1\}$

> TODO

## More `purrr`

Make a function called `factorial` that uses `multiply_by` and `reduce` to find the factorial of a number. (Recall that `factorial(4)` returns $(((1 \times 2) \times 3) \times 4)$.)

> TODO

Challenge question! `purrr` has `map_*` functions for dataframes too! Using `?<func>` to check the documentation of the functions used below, and see if you can describe what exactly is happening in each section of the pipe. 
```{r}
iris %>% split(.$Species) %>% map_dfr(function(df){df %>% summarise_if(is.numeric, sum)}, .id = "f")
```

> TODO

# Mini-projects

The best way to get better at data manipulation, data import, and data cleaning is by practicing with wild datasets! These two miniature data science projects are designed to give you experience cleaning and tidying datasets with `dplyr` and `tidyr`. 

## Cleaning the `articles` dataset

In some spreadsheet software, view `data/wellcome_apce_articles.csv`. Read and clean this dataset. You will need to use heavily use `readr`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`, and even `stringr` to accomplish this. For tips, review all the functions in [`r2`](r2.html). Feel free to email `contact@arun.run` with any questions or for hints.

## Tidying the `plant-ants` dataset

In some spreadsheet software, view `data/plant-ants.xls`. Read and clean this dataset. Additionally, put it into a `tidy` format. You will need to use heavily use `readxl`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`. For tips, review all the functions in [`r2`](r2.html). Feel free to email `contact@arun.run` with any questions or for hints.
