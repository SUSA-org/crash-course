# Installing Python & Anaconda
## For Mac
1. Visit [the Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) and click the Mac icon. Install the Python 3.6 version of Anaconda.
2. Run the downloaded .pkg file, and begin to step through the installation process. On the "Destination Select" stage, highlight "Install for me only" before continuing. 
3. When finished, Anaconda, Python, pip, and other Python libraries will be installed on your machine. To test your installation, navigate to the anaconda3 folder, usually found by typing the following into your Terminal and pressing Enter:
```bash
cd ~/anaconda3/
```
Then, run the conda command in the /bin/ folder by typing the following into your Terminal and pressing Enter:
```bash
./bin/conda list
```
