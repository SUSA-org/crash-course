You both want to start working on making a better model, and then compare which prototype performs better, but you don't want to get in the way of each other's work. So, you make a branch named `xg_boost`, and your friend makes a branch named `clockwork_rnn`.

Alternatively, if your friend's model performs better, they can merge their `clockwork_rnn` branch into the `master` branch and you and your friend can work on that new model together. As one last possibility, suppose neither the `xg_boost` model nor the `clockwork_rnn` model outperform the model in the master branch. Then, you can both easily switch back to the `master` branch with a single command, and try new ideas without skipping a beat. This is the value of Git, especially for complex or group projects."
