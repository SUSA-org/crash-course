    "# SUSA CX Kaggle Capstone Project\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the last four weeks of your semester in SUSA's Career Exploration committee! Now that you've participated in nearly a dozen workshops on Python, R, data science, and machine learning, we're going to guide you through a four-week collaborative Kaggle competition with your peers in Career Exploration. We want to give you the experience of working with real data, using real machine learning algorithms, in an educational setting. You will have to make use of your data computing skills in Python, dive into reading kernels on the Kaggle website, use visualization and feature engineering to improve your score, and maybe even pick up a few advanced deep learning models along the way. \n",
    "\n",
    "If this sounds a bit intimidating right now, do not fret! Your SUSA Mentors will be there to mentor you through the whole thing. Don't worry if our code, our approach, or any part of this process seems unnatural. It is. It takes time to learn, and it takes time to teach. We're learning as we make these tutorials, too! So without further ado, let's get cracking!\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Kaggle is platform that hosts datasets & data science competitions. Kaggle started off as a small community of data science practitioners looking to hone their hobbying skills and meet like-minded folks, not unlike SUSA! :)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Today they host many different types of competitions for [money from 1k to 1000k](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2018), [jobs](https://www.kaggle.com/jobs), [internships](https://www.kaggle.com/c/two-sigma-connect-rental-listing-inquiries) e.g. 2Sigma, and [prestige](https://www.kaggle.com/c/imagenet-object-detection-challenge). The best competitors get special badges that give their comments, contributions, and teams special status in the community. You can build your reputation by posting helpful notebooks (called `kernels` by Kaggle), like this one, on a Kaggle dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's lots more to Kaggle. If you're interested some examples in getting started with Kaggle competitions, or how it works, see our [Kaggle Workshop slides!](https://github.com/ngundotra/SUSA_Kaggle_Workshop)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Kaggle Competition: Housing Prices\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will be working with the [**Housing Prices**](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/) competition on the Kaggle website. The competition deals with accurately predicting the sales prices of houses in Ames, Iowa. More information on the dataset and competition will follow shortly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accessing the `House Prices` Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "While you can access these datasets online at the [Kaggle webpage for this competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data), we have already downloaded the data for you and placed it in the `crash-course/Kaggle/DATA/house-prices/` directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of the CX Capstone Project\n",
    "\n",
    "So where does Kaggle fit in into your CX education?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Logistics\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is going to be tough and long, but we will be there with you through the whole thing. Additionally, you won't be working alone - we have used your input to assign you into teams of 3 - 4 members. These will be your team members for the rest of the semester, so get to know each other a little!\n",
    "\n",
    "The project will last the remaining 4 weeks of Career Ex, and one hour per each weekly CX meeting will be devoted to working on it with your team (The other hour will be devoted to guest speakers). However, that only leaves 4 hours of in-class time to work on the project. In order to complete it successfully, it is highly likely that you and your team will have to do some work outside of the weekly CX meetings. To help you stay accountable for yourself, we will be providing you with space and times to meet with SUSA Mentors to help.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Teams \n",
    "\n",
    "You can find the breakdown of the teams with this link:\n",
    "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1twOPXsil1ZyQ1_Rt770ubUbmdQto36OYNNhhBODukPI/edit?usp=sharing\n",
    "\n",
    "I would start by getting the Slack handle or phone number (or other contact info) of all the other members in your group so that you can easily communicate outside of the weekly meetings. It's up to you guys to determine how you are going to meet. We highly encourage all work on the project to be done together, in-person.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mandatory Office Hours\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this is such a large project, you and your team will surely have to work on it outside of meetings. In order to get you guys to seek help from this project, we are making it **mandatory** for you and your group to attend **two (2)** SUSA office hours over the next 4 weeks. This will allow questions to be answered outside of the regular meetings and will help promote collaboration with more experienced SUSA members.\n",
    "\n",
    "The schedule of SUSA office hours are below:\n",
    "https://susa.berkeley.edu/calendar#officehours-table\n",
    "\n",
    "We understand that most of you will end up going to Arun or Patrick's office hours, but we highly encourage you to go to other people's office hours as well. There are many qualified SUSA mentors who can help and this could be an opportunity for you to meet them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SUSA Datathon\n",
    "\n",
    "One other time that we are hoping you will work on your Kaggle projects is during the SUSA Datathon. The time and place of the event is still tentative, but it will likely 4-8PM on Sunday 4/15. At the Datathon, members from many SUSA committees, notably Data Consulting, Research & Publication, and Career Exploration, will all meet up and work on their respective projects together. There will be many other SUSA members there to help you and it should be a great environment for you and your group to work. This is also another great opportunity to meet other experienced SUSA members and get a taste for other committees in the club. More details about this event will be released later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Git\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that this is a collaborative project, you'll need to work with your team members on the same codebase simutaneously! This is fortunately simple with Git, which you learned in your very first workshop. Visit `py0` if you need a refresher, but we will be going over the steps for collaborative work here too.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, decide on which one of you will be hosting the forked Github repository for `crash-course`. Ideally, this would be someone with some GitHub experience and a GitHub account. If no one on your team has a GitHub account, one of you should sign up for one. For our examples, we will call this person's account name `rprincess`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Next, have the above person navigate to the [SUSA crash-course repository](https://github.com/SUSA-org/crash-course) and click the `Fork` button. GitHub will make a copy of the crash-course repository in your team member's account. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Each one of you can download the `rprincess` repository to your local computer with the following command: `git clone https://github.com/rprincess/crash-course.git`. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Feel free to work within the repository and use `git pull origin` and `git add -A && git commit -am \"My example message here\" && git push` to pull/push your local repository to the `rprincess` online repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have any questions, just Slack Lucas, Noah, Patrick, or Arun and we can help you with your Git workflow."

    "# The Data Science Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, there are a few key steps to begin working with a dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to **understand what the dataset actually is about**, and what we are trying to do with it. Key to this stage is understanding what each row of the dataset represents, as well as what each column indicates. You can read more about this dataset by looking at the dataset itself, or reading the data dictionary in `crash-course/Kaggle/DATA/house-prices/data_description.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, before we can even do exploratory data analysis, we need to **clean our dataset**. It is very helpful to identify the size of the dataset, so we know how many samples we have. We need to determine a consistent method of dealing with missing values, such as setting them to a value, removing the feature entirely, interpolating values, etc. Other crucial steps are separating into training and validation, as well as creating elementary data plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, we have **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**. The point of this phase is to inspect & visualize key relationships, trends, outliers, and issues with our data. By conducting EDA, we get a better sense of the underlying structure of our data, and which features are most important. Especially since we have 81 features, we would like to select the features that are most important to our analysis before we begin modeling `SalePrice`. Once we have an idea about which features to use and how they relate to one another, our modeling stage will be more informed and robust. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fourth, we have the **modeling phase**, consisting of **model selection** and **model training**. Here, we select a predictive model to train on our features, and then actually train the model! In this first week, we will be using linear regression as a first-pass. In later weeks of the SUSA CX Kaggle Capstone project, we will be using more advanced models like random forest and neural networks. Depending on the model we are using, it is important to verify the model's assumptions before fully pledging to that model. Additionally, we may use **validation** in this stage to select certain hyperparameters for our model selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we have the **model evaluation phase**. Here, we compute a metric for our model's performance, usually by  summing the squared errors of the model's predictions on the test set. This stage allows us to effectively compare various data cleaning and modeling selection decisions, by giving us a single comparable value for performance across our potential models.\n",
    "\n",

    "## I. Understanding our Dataset \n",
    "Our dataset is about houses in Iowa! According to the Kaggle webpage, the competition is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won’t begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition’s dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.\n",
    "With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.\n",
    "\n",
    "More explicitly, our dataset has 81 columns, or features: \n",
    "1. `SalePrice`, our response variable $Y$ that we are trying to predict accurately and precisely \n",
    "2. `Id`, a simple identification variable\n",
    "3. 79 explanatory variables $X_k$ that we can use to predict `SalePrice`. Some of the variables are categorical, and others are continuous quantitative. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the next four weeks to to create a model that trains on (some of) the 79 explanators from the training set to predict `SalePrice` well in the test set. \n",
    "\n",
    "How will we know which explanators to use? We can start with some intuition and research into what each column represents by reading the data dictionary in `crash-course/Kaggle/DATA/house-prices/data_description.txt`. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Please take a moment to read over this dictionary, as you will need to have a keen sense of these features for the weeks ahead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've talked a bit about this dataset, let's actually take a look at it. The first step is to load in the data! We will store this in a `pandas` dataframe."

    "## Data Cleaning Functions\n",
    "We provide some functions to help with data cleaning and preprocessing. One is creating one hot encodings of various features, and the latter is converting a categorical feature into values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### One Hot Encoding for Unordered Categorical Variables\n",
    "Consider we have a feature `committee` for a data frame of SUSA members. Let's say for sake of simplicity there are four committees, `CX`, `DC`, `RP`, and `WD`. There is no inherent ordering to the features, but each member is only in one committee. Thus we can replace this categorical variable with a single boolean for `committee`. If a member is a part of `CX`, then they will have a $1$ for `DC` and $0$ for all other variables. We have written this function for you in `oneHotFeature`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ordered Categorical Variables\n",
    "Consider we have a feature `attendance` for a data frame of SUSA members. Let's say there are $3$ possible values, `Good`, `Ok`, `Poor`. These inherently have an ordering, `Good` is better than `Okay` which is better than `Poor`. We can assign a numerical value to these, such as $0$ for `Poor`, $1$ for `Ok`, and $2$ for `Good`. We have written this function for you in `categoricalToQuantitative`.\n",

Even among expert statisticians, this is regarded as a hard skill, bordering on art. Oftentimes, industry experts will provide insight as to what the right features to select are, and stasticians (like ourselves) will have to create a model from those features.\n",

    "After Spring Break, we will be guiding you through a four-week collaborative Kaggle competition with your peers in Career Exploration! We want to give you the experience of working with real data, using real machine learning algorithms, in an educational setting. You will have to choose either Python or R, and dive into reading kernels on the Kaggle website, use visualization and feature engineering to improve your score, and maybe even pick up a few advanced deep learning models along the way. If this sounds a bit intimidating right now, do not fret! Your SUSA Mentors will be there to mentor you through the whole thing. So rest up during Spring Break, and come back ready to tackle your biggest data challenge yet!\n",
